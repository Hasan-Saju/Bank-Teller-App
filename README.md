## Features

### Fraud Detection Model

This model uses python to detect fraudulent transactions in the dataset. Using **Isolation Forest** from the `sklearn` library. It mainly identifies outliers in the various data topics and flags unusual transaction behaviors.

#### Key features

- **Isolation Forest for Fraud Detection:** Detects anomalies in transactions based on multiple features.
- **Categorical Encoding:** Handles categorical data (transaction location) by encoding it for model compatibility.
- **Dynamic Feature Selection:** Automatically adjusts feature selection based on data columns.
- **Visualization:** Visualizes fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions in a scatter plot.

#### Data Description

The script uses a sample dataset (for demonstration purposes) with the following fields:

- **transaction_id**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **amount**: Transaction amount.
- **transaction_time**: Time of transaction (0-23 hours).
- **transaction_location**: Location of the transaction ('local' or 'foreign').
- **account_balance**: Account balance at the time of the transaction.

#### How It Works

1. **Generate Sample Data**: A synthetic dataset is created with transaction details, including some outliers to simulate fraud.
2. **Encoding Categorical Features**: Converts the categorical 'transaction_location' field into binary features.
3. **Isolation Forest Model**: An **Isolation Forest** model is trained on the data to detect anomalies.
4. **Prediction and Labeling**: Each transaction is classified as either "Fraudulent" or "Legitimate" based on the model's prediction.
5. **Visualization**: The results are plotted, where fraudulent transactions are highlighted in red and legitimate ones in green.

#### Code Explanation

- **Data Simulation**: Generates a synthetic dataset with normal transaction patterns and outliers.
- **Feature Encoding**: Uses `pd.get_dummies()` to encode the `transaction_location` field.
- **Dynamic Feature Selection**: Dynamically selects features based on available columns.
- **Isolation Forest Model**: The `IsolationForest` algorithm is applied to identify potential fraudulent transactions.
- **Visualization**: A scatter plot shows transaction amounts, with fraudulent transactions in red and legitimate ones in green.

#### Expected Output

- **Fraud Detection Results Table**: Lists each transaction with its `transaction_id`, `amount`, `transaction_time`, `transaction_location`, and `is_fraud` status.
- **Scatter Plot**: A scatter plot with each transaction amount. Fraudulent transactions are marked in red, and legitimate transactions are marked in green.

## Installation

### Frontend

**Prerequisites:**

Check if Node.js and npm are installed.

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

**Installation:**

To install and run the frontend of the app for development, go to the _client_ directory, install the dependencies and then start the development server on your local device.

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Credentials:**

The dummy Employee/Teller profile credentials for testing, as saved in `server/BankTellerProject/db.sqlite3`:

- Employee ID: *787713*
- Password: *admin*

Alternatively, you can create a new Teller profile by navigating to the `/admin/create_teller` route. This is temporarily in place for testing purposes.

The dummy Client profile credentials for testing, as saved in `server/BankTellerProject/db.sqlite3`:

- Client ID: *9712826163*
- Password: *client*

**Deployment:**

Use `npm run build` to build the finished project for production.

### Fraud Detection Model

**Prerequisites:**

Check if all the necessary libraries are installed.

```bash
pip show pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

# Installation:Backend:

# Setting Up and Running the Project

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment, installing dependencies, and running the project.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Version 3.x)
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- Additional project-specific requirements (specified in `requirements.txt`)

---

## Steps for Setting Up the Environment

### 1. Create a New Conda Environment

Create a new isolated environment named `test_env` with Python and the Anaconda distribution installed:

```bash
conda create -n test_env python anaconda
```

### 2. Activate the Environment

Switch to the newly created environment:

```bash
conda activate test_env
```

### 3. Deactivate the Environment

If you need to exit the environment, deactivate it using:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

### 4. Remove the Environment (if necessary)

To completely remove the environment along with all installed dependencies:

```bash
conda remove -n test_env --all
```

### 5. Verify Existing Environments

List all available Conda environments:

```bash
conda env list
```

---

## Installing Project Dependencies

Ensure you are in the correct environment (`test_env`) before installing dependencies.

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```

2. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
    ```

    **Note**: Replace `/path/to/requirements.txt` with the actual path to your `requirements.txt` file.

---

## Running the Project

1. Ensure the environment is active:

    ```bash
    conda activate test_env
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory (if not already there):

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

4. Open a browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal output (typically `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`).

---

## Additional Notes

- **Database Setup**: Ensure your database is configured correctly (if applicable). Update `settings.py` with the correct database credentials.
- **Environment Variables**: If the project relies on specific environment variables, set them up before running the server. Use tools like `.env` files for easier management.
- **Static Files**: Run `collectstatic` if the project requires static files to be served (for production):

    ```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```

Feel free to expand or customize this guide further based on your projectâ€™s specific requirements!



**Installation:**

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

Run the script `Fraud Detection Model.py` in a Python environment to see the fraud detection results printed to the console.

View the scatter plot to visually assess the detected fraudulent transactions.
